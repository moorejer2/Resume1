This is the code base for a Statistical Capture and Analysis tool I wrote from 2011-2013.

The tech stack is Django/Spring/Angular with the assumption of both a MongoDB for real-time stats capture and reporting back (served multiple sports media markets) and a standard SQL.

The tool has templates for creating media markets, school districts, divisions, schools and sports along with the corresponding templates for any and all sports that are supported by each schoool.
